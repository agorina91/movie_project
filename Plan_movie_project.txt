OUTLINE AND QUESTIONS

We are investigating the correlation between MPAA rating
and the reviews from both users and critics using IMDB and Metacritic.
We want to figure out whether the movies with strong language, frightening scenes,
scenes with characters smoking, drinking, using drugs, etc. get better reviews from critics
and users, and if there is any correlation at all. Additionally, we assume that there exists
a phenomenon of biased reviews: if your friends liked the movie, then you are more likely to write
a positive review as well. We are looking at a subset of American movies released in the two years.


What are the movies marked as 'severe' in Frightening & Intense Scenes/Alcohol, Drugs & Smoking/
Profanity/Violence & Gore/Sex & Nudity?
What's the average user rating and critics rating?

What are the movies marked 'mild' Frightening & Intense Scenes/Alcohol, Drugs & Smoking/
